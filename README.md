# Description 

My task was to create a fitness app that allows the user to view, create and track daily workouts. The user is able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. The user is able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, the user is able to track the distance traveled.

# Features
